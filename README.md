# DKStringSearch

This application was developed using Netbeans on Windows 7, I wrote two search algorithms, 
one is an implementation of a classic algorithm Rabin Karp and the other is a new algorithm I wrote from scratch.

The application has a Java Swing GUI that allows you to input a blob of text and then search using both search methods.

I worte the Application as a means of testing my algorithm, I used a few profiling tools in Netbeans
to check the search times, my new algorithm was faster:-)
